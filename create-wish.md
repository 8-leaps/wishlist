# Make Your Wish

- Read the [Wishlist manifesto](manifesto.md) and the [pull request guidelines](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/wish.md) for wishes to ensure your wish complies before making a pull request.
- Search if a similar wish exists before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate. If it is, try and contribute to the best one instead of making your own.
- Fork and edit the wish template to get startedðŸ‘‰[_wish.md](https://gist.github.com/unameit10000000/a660a242dcbef241f7b04e507d7c8431)
- **Make sure you read the [pull request guidelines](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/wish.md) again before submitting a pull request for your wish to be added here.**

Thanks for wishing!ðŸŒŸðŸ˜Ž
