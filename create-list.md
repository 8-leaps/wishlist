# Creating Your Own Wishlist

- Read the [Wishlist manifesto](manifesto.md) and the [pull request guidelines](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/wishlist.md) for lists to ensure your list complies before making a pull request.
- Search this list before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate. If it is, try and contribute to the best one instead of making your own.
- **Make sure you read the [pull request guidelines](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/wishlist.md) again before submitting a pull request for your list to be added here.**

Happy wishlisting!ðŸ“œðŸ˜Ž
